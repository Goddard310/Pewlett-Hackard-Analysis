# PH Retirement Analysis
&nbsp;See Employee_Database_challenge.sql

## Overview of Project
We are preparing for the "silver tsunami" with a very large group of employees heading into retirement age.  To prepare for this loss of talent & human capital, we would like to assess the true impact and implement a mentorship program.  

### Analysis Results
- Total targeted for retirement:  90,398
- Mentorship eligible:  1,940
- Senior Engineers (an expensive role to replace), are far & away the most commonly going to retire in the near-term at: 29,414

### Conclusion
It's clear that there need to be aggressive steps to manage the transition of talent over the next 5-10 years.  While the mentorship program is an excellent first step, there is **not** currently an adequate amount of mentorship-eligibile candidates.  Particularly in engineering roles - the lifeblood of Pewlett Hackard.  

Clearly, additional incentives as a part of the mentorship program need to be implemented.  These will keep mentors on longer while also continuing to develop the next crop of talent.
